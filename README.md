scrollpersist
=============

Persist page scrolling to last position when user returns back to a visited page.
No dependencies are required to run.

Simply include:
```
<script src="scrollpersist.js" data-delay="1000"></script>
```
anywhere on your page and the user will resume from their last scroll position when they return to that page.

### Optional Addons
For smooth animated scrolling you can also include jQuery and jQuery.scrollTo on your page too:
```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-scrollTo/2.1.2/jquery.scrollTo.min.js"></script>
<script src="scrollpersist.js" data-delay="1000"></script>
```
